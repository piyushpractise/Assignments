    "Forward propagation is the process by which input data is passed through the neural network to generate predictions or outputs. Its primary purpose is to compute the network's predicted output for a given input. During forward propagation, the input data is transformed as it passes through the network's layers, with each layer applying certain mathematical operations to produce an output that represents the network's prediction. The final output can then be compared to the actual target values to compute the loss, which is used to update the network's parameters during the subsequent backward propagation (backpropagation) phase."
