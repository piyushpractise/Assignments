    "* **Linear Regression:** This model is used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The output is a linear combination of the input features, and the model tries to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression:** Unlike linear regression, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The output is transformed using the logistic (sigmoid) function to ensure that it lies between 0 and 1, which can then be interpreted as the probability of belonging to one of the classes.\n",
    "* **Example of Logistic Regression:** Imagine a scenario where you want to predict whether an email is spam (class 1) or not (class 0) based on the presence of certain keywords. Since this is a classification problem with two discrete classes, logistic regression would be more appropriate."

    "Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. In logistic regression, two common forms of regularization are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). These penalties discourage large coefficients for the features, which helps to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting."
