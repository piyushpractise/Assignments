    "##### FOR Loop:\n",
    "    A FOR loop is used when we want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.) for a specific number of times. It's typically used when we know beforehand how many iterations are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Let's say if we want to print the elements of a list using a FOR loop:\n",
    "        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "        for num in numbers:\n",
    "            print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "    In above example, the loop iterates over each element in the numbers list and prints it. We are using a FOR loop because you know the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### WHILE Loop:\n",
    "    A WHILE loop is used when we want to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It's often used when we don't know how many iterations will be needed in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Suppose if we want to find the factorial of a number using a WHILE loop:\n",
    "        number = 5\n",
    "        factorial = 1\n",
    "        counter = 1\n",
    "        while counter <= number:\n",
    "            factorial *= counter\n",
    "            counter += 1\n",
    "        print(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    In above example, the loop calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop. The loop continues to multiply the factorial by counter and increments counter until counter becomes greater than number."
