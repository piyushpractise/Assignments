    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    * **Improved predictive accuracy:** Boosting can significantly enhance the performance of models, especially in situations where individual weak learners perform poorly.\n",
    "    * **Robustness to overfitting:** Many boosting algorithms incorporate regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, making them more robust.\n",
    "    * **Handling class imbalance:** Boosting can handle class imbalance well by assigning higher weights to misclassified minority class samples.\n",
    "    * **Versatility:** Boosting can be applied to various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limitations of Boosting Techniques:\n",
    "    * **Sensitive to noise and outliers:** Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data or outliers, which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "    * **Computationally expensive:** Training multiple weak learners sequentially can be time-consuming, especially with a large number of iterations.\n",
    "    * **Requires careful tuning:** Proper hyperparameter tuning is essential for achieving good results with boosting algorithms.\n",
    "    * **Less interpretable:** The final boosted model can be complex and challenging to interpret compared to individual weak learners."
