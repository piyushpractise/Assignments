    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a hybrid regularization technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties in the regression cost function. It's used to address multicollinearity and perform feature selection while providing some level of stability for coefficients. It differs from other techniques like Ridge and Lasso by incorporating both L1 and L2 penalties, allowing it to capture advantages from both."

Cross-validation helps identify the combination of alpha and l1_ratio that minimizes prediction error on a validation set."
