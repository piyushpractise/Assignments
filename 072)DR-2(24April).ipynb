    "A projection in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) refers to the transformation of data points from their original high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional subspace. In PCA, projections are used to find a set of orthogonal axes (principal components) in the original feature space such that the variance of the data along these axes is maximized."

    "The optimization problem in PCA aims to find a set of principal components such that they maximize the variance of the data when projected onto these components. Mathematically, PCA seeks to find the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. These eigenvectors correspond to the principal components, and the optimization problem aims to maximize the eigenvalues associated with these eigenvectors. Essentially, PCA is trying to achieve dimensionality reduction while retaining as much variance as possible."

    "PCA handles data with high variance in some dimensions but low variance in others by identifying the principal components that capture the directions of maximum variance. When there is high variance in certain dimensions, those dimensions will have a significant impact on the principal components. Conversely, dimensions with low variance will have a smaller influence on the principal components. PCA effectively reduces the impact of low-variance dimensions in the reduced-dimensional representation, allowing it to focus on the dimensions that contribute most to the data's variance."
