    "#### Part 1: Theoretical Questions\n",
    "#### Answer 1\n",
    "TensorFlow primarily uses two data structures:\n",
    "- **Tensors:** Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays, similar to NumPy arrays, but with additional capabilities for GPU acceleration and distributed computing. Examples include scalars (0-dimensional tensors), vectors (1-dimensional tensors), and matrices (2-dimensional tensors).\n",
    "- **Graphs:** TensorFlow uses a computational graph to define and execute operations. The graph contains nodes that represent operations and edges that represent the flow of data (tensors) between these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Answer 2\n",
    "- **Constant:** TensorFlow constants are used to create tensors with fixed values that cannot be changed during the execution of a computation graph. These values are set when the constant is defined and cannot be modified. For example:\n",
    "     `constant_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "- **Variable:** TensorFlow variables are used to create tensors whose values can be changed during training or during the execution of a computation graph. Variables are typically used to store model parameters like weights and biases. For example:\n",
    "     `variable_tensor = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Answer 3\n",
    "- **Matrix Addition:** In TensorFlow, matrix addition is performed using the `tf.add()` function, and it adds corresponding elements of two matrices with the same shape. For example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "     mA = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "     mB = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "     result = tf.add(mA, mB)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "- **Matrix Multiplication:** Matrix multiplication is done with the `tf.matmul()` function, and it computes the dot product of two matrices if they are conformable for multiplication. For example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "     mA = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "     mB = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "     result = tf.matmul(mA, mB)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "- **Element-Wise Operations:** Element-wise operations are performed by applying operations to each element of a tensor independently. For example, element-wise addition can be done using `tf.add()`, and element-wise multiplication can be done using `tf.multiply()`. Here's an example of element-wise multiplication:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "     tA = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "     tB = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "     result = tf.multiply(tA, tB)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "---"
