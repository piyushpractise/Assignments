    "A contingency matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in the context of binary classification. It summarizes the true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) predictions made by the model. The contingency matrix is useful for calculating various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)."

    "A pair confusion matrix is a modified form of the confusion matrix used in multi-label classification scenarios. In multi-label classification, an instance can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. A regular confusion matrix is not well-suited for such cases. The pair confusion matrix focuses on pairs of classes and tracks whether pairs of classes are correctly or incorrectly predicted together. It can be useful when we need to analyze relationships between class pairs."
