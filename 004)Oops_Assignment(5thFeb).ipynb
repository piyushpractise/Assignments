    "    Encapsulation: It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and hides the internal details, promoting data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: It involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects. It allows us to create a clear and concise representation of real-world entities while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: It allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). It also enables code reusability, extensibility, and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows you to define methods in the superclass that can be overridden in subclasses, enabling different classes to have different implementations for the same method name."
