    "**Web Scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing HTML or other structured data formats, and extracting useful information. Web scraping is used to automate data collection from websites when manual data entry or other methods are impractical or inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where Web Scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "1. **Data Aggregation**: Web scraping is used to collect data from various sources on the internet, such as news articles, product prices, stock market data, weather forecasts, and more. This aggregated data can be used for analysis, reporting, or building applications.\n",
    "2. **Competitor Analysis**: Businesses use web scraping to monitor and analyze their competitors' websites. This can include tracking product prices, monitoring product reviews, or analyzing marketing strategies.\n",
    "3. **Research and Analysis**: Researchers and analysts use web scraping to gather data for various studies and reports. This can include collecting social media data, academic publications, job postings, and demographic information."

    "1. **Manual Scraping**: Manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a local document.\n",
    "2. **Regular Expressions**: Using regular expressions to search for and extract specific patterns of data from HTML or text.\n",
    "3. **DOM Parsing**: Using programming languages like JavaScript to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages and extract data.\n",
    "4. **APIs**: Many websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access structured data directly without scraping HTML. This is the preferred method when available.\n",
    "5. **Web Scraping Libraries**: Using specialized libraries and tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Puppeteer to automate web scraping tasks."
