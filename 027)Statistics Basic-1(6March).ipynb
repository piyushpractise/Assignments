For instance, we can't calculate a meaningful average for nominal data, but we can for ratio data. Treating data at a higher level of measurement as if it were at a lower level can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, calculating the average of nominal data like eye colors doesn't make sense, as there's no meaningful arithmetic interpretation of color categories."
