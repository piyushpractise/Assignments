    "The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It's a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It's particularly useful when there's an uneven class distribution. F1 score can be calculated using the formula: F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). Unlike accuracy, which might be high even when dealing with imbalanced classes, the F1 score considers both false positives and false negatives."

    "Multiclass classification involves predicting the class label from more than two classes. Logistic regression can be extended to handle multiclass problems using techniques like one-vs-all (OvA) or softmax regression. In OvA, we train a separate binary logistic regression classifier for each class, treating one class as positive and the rest as negative. In softmax regression, a single model computes the probabilities for all classes using the softmax function."
