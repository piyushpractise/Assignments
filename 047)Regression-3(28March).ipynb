    "**Ridge Regression** is a regularization technique used in linear regression to address multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. In Ridge Regression, a penalty term proportional to the sum of squared coefficients is added to the least squares cost function. This penalty, controlled by the tuning parameter (lambda), shrinks the coefficients towards zero without making them exactly zero.\n",
