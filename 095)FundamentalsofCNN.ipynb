    "    - Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image or a video frame. It not only classifies the objects but also provides their precise positions in the image.\n",
    "    - Object detection typically returns a bounding box around each detected object and labels them. It can identify multiple objects within a single image.\n",
    "    - Examples of object detection include self-driving cars identifying pedestrians and other vehicles, surveillance systems tracking people, and face detection in cameras.\n",

    "    - Object classification, on the other hand, focuses on categorizing an entire image into predefined classes or categories. It doesn't provide the exact location of objects within the image.\n",
    "    - In object classification, the model assigns a single label to the entire image, indicating what it contains.\n",

    "2. **Spatial Information:** Images preserve spatial information. The arrangement of pixels encodes the position and relationships between objects in the image.\n",
