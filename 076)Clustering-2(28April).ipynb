    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters by successively merging or splitting existing clusters based on similarity or dissimilarity measures. It differs from other clustering techniques in that it creates a tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram, which provides a visual representation of the relationships between data points at various levels of granularity."

    "The two main types of hierarchical clustering algorithms are:\n",
    "1. **Agglomerative Clustering:** This method starts with each data point as a single cluster and iteratively merges clusters based on a linkage criterion such as single linkage (minimum pairwise distance), complete linkage (maximum pairwise distance), or average linkage (average pairwise distance). Agglomerative clustering moves from the bottom (individual data points) to the top (a single cluster representing all data points).\n",
    "2. **Divisive Clustering:** In contrast to agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering starts with a single cluster containing all data points and recursively divides it into smaller clusters. This approach moves from the top (all data points) to the bottom (individual data points) of the hierarchy."
